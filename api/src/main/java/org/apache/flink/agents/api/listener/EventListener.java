/**
 * Interface for event listeners that are notified when business events are received for processing.

 * <p>EventListener provides a callback mechanism triggered at the beginning of event processing.
 * This is useful for monitoring, metrics collection, debugging, or triggering side effects based on
 * event reception. Runtime observability records such as execution trace lifecycle events are
 * written to Event Log but are not delivered to this listener.
 *
 * <p>Event listeners are executed synchronously when an event is received, before any actions are
 * triggered. Implementations should be lightweight and avoid blocking operations to prevent
 * impacting agent performance.
 *
 * <p><strong>Note:</strong> Implementing classes must provide a public no-argument constructor to
 * allow for dynamic instantiation by the agent.
