     * sliding window of at most that many concurrent tool calls. On **Java**, concurrent in-batch
     * execution requires **JDK 21+** (Continuation API); below JDK 21 the batch still runs but tool
     * calls execute serially regardless of this setting.
     *
     * <p><b>Important:</b> the default is {@code availableProcessors()}, so multi-tool batches run
     * in parallel out of the box on most hosts (JDK 21+). Parallel tool batches use the same {@link
     * #NUM_ASYNC_THREADS} fixed thread pool as chat and RAG async work. That pool is created once
     * per operator subtask and shared by every key handled by that subtask — not a separate pool
     * per key. Built-in actions for one key run one at a time, so a chat async call and a tool
     * batch on the same key do not overlap in the usual chat → tool flow; contention shows up
     * mainly across keys on the same subtask (or when several keys each run large parallel
     * batches). With defaults ({@code num-async-threads = 2 × cores}, {@code tool-call.parallelism
     * = cores}), one batch can hold up to half of the pool; multiple busy keys can still saturate
     * it. Lower this value (for example {@code 1} or {@code 2}) or raise {@link #NUM_ASYNC_THREADS}
     * when mixing heavy tool batches with chat/RAG on hot subtasks.

     * <p><b>Thread reclamation:</b> the timeout unblocks the action but does not interrupt a tool
     * that is still running. {@code cancel(true)} cannot interrupt an in-flight {@code
     * CompletableFuture}, so a hung tool keeps its worker thread in the shared {@link
     * #NUM_ASYNC_THREADS} pool until it returns on its own. That thread is not reclaimed by the
     * timeout and stays unavailable to other keys on the same subtask, so a tool that never returns
     * permanently reduces pool capacity. Bound blocking work inside the tool itself (for example an
     * HTTP client read timeout) rather than relying on this batch timeout to free the thread.
