     *
     * <p>{@code outputSchema} is framework-level execution metadata, kept off {@code modelParams}
     * so that it can never reach a provider SDK request as a generation parameter. It is either a
     * POJO {@link Class} or an {@link org.apache.flink.agents.api.agents.OutputSchema} (a {@code
     * RowTypeInfo} wrapper); the two cases are distinguished by the connection that consumes it.
     *
     * <p>A schema must not be handed to a connection that has no native translation for it: this
     * default implementation rejects a non-null {@code outputSchema} rather than dropping it, so an
     * unconstrained response can never be mistaken for a schema-conforming one. A null {@code
     * outputSchema} delegates to {@link #chat(List, List, Map)}. A connection that does translate a
     * schema into a native provider parameter overrides this overload, and reports its capability
     * via {@link #supportsNativeStructuredOutput(String)}.
     *
     * <p>No connection translates an {@link org.apache.flink.agents.api.agents.OutputSchema}, and
     * so a {@code RowTypeInfo}, natively, and what follows differs by connection. One that
     * overrides this overload applies its native parameter only for a POJO {@link Class}, so it
     * skips the {@code RowTypeInfo} and leaves the request unchanged, and the caller keeps the
     * prompt-engineering fallback. One that does not override it rejects the {@code RowTypeInfo}
     * through the default body above, which refuses every non-null schema alike. The skip is a
     * deliberate, permanent fallback rather than a translation still to be written; the rejection
     * is the separate case of a connection that could otherwise only drop the schema silently.
     *
     * <p>An overriding connection renders a POJO with its provider SDK's own schema generator, and
     * a render failure is not reported here because those generators produce a schema for every
     * class they are handed. The asymmetry with the Python side is imposed by the vendor libraries
     * rather than chosen: Pydantic genuinely raises on a model it cannot express, and the Python
     * connections wrap that. A schema the SDK does render is sent as rendered even when it declares
     * no properties; whether such a document is usable is the receiving provider's to judge.
     *
     * <p>The ReAct prompt path renders through a different generator, Jackson, rather than through
     * any provider SDK, and a POJO Jackson cannot render is rejected there rather than reaching the
     * prompt. Because the two paths use different generators, that rejection says nothing about
     * what a connection does with the same POJO.
