/**
 * Marks a Java method as an agent action triggered by event types or condition expressions.
 *
 * <p>Each {@link #value()} entry is either an exact event-type name or a condition expression that
 * evaluates to boolean. Multiple entries use OR semantics. An entry matching the event-type syntax
 * is classified as an event type rather than as a condition expression. To combine an event-type
 * restriction and an attribute predicate using AND, place both in a single expression, for example
 * {@code type == EventType.InputEvent && score > 5}.
 *
 * <p>The event-type syntax is a bare or dotted name, such as {@code order.created} or {@code
 * order-created}; each segment may contain hyphens. Boolean attribute conditions must therefore be
 * explicit, for example {@code ready == true}.
 *
 * <p>The API preserves entries as raw strings. Entries are classified and condition expressions are
 * validated when the agent plan is built.
 *
 * <p>Set {@link #target()} to a {@link PythonFunction} configured with a module for a
 * cross-language action. The annotated Java method is not invoked for such actions.
