## Overview

A [Skill]({{< ref "docs/development/skills" >}}) is a self-contained package of instructions, and optionally scripts and reference files, that teaches the agent how to perform a specialized task. Skills are loaded with *progressive disclosure*: only each skill's name and description are shown to the agent up front, and the full instructions are pulled in on demand when the agent decides a skill is relevant.

This quickstart builds a small streaming agent that answers arithmetic questions. Rather than letting the LLM compute by itself, the agent exposes a `math-calculator` skill; for each question the agent loads the skill and follows its instructions to compute the result with the `bc` calculator through the built-in `bash` tool. It demonstrates the full skill lifecycle — discovery, activation, and execution — in a Flink streaming job.

## Code Walkthrough

### Define the Skill

A skill is a directory containing a `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter (loaded at discovery time) and a Markdown body (loaded on activation). Here is `skills/math-calculator/SKILL.md`:

````markdown
---
name: math-calculator
description: Calculate mathematical expressions using shell commands. Use when the user asks to perform arithmetic calculations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, or powers.
license: Apache-2.0
compatibility: Requires bash with bc (basic calculator)
---

# Math Calculator Skill

## When to Use
Use this skill when the user asks to evaluate a numeric expression.

## Method
Pipe the expression into the `bc` (basic calculator) command:

```bash
echo "(2 + 3) * 4" | bc
# Output: 20
```
````

### Create the Agent

The agent declares where to load skills from with the `@skills`/`@Skills` decorator/annotation, and enables the skill on its chat model by listing it in `skills` together with the `allowed_commands` whitelist for the `bash` tool. For more details, please refer to the [Skills]({{< ref "docs/development/skills" >}}) documentation.

**Key points:**
- `@skills`/`@Skills` declares a skill source. `Skills.from_package` (Python) loads skills bundled inside an installed package by `(package, resource)`; `Skills.fromClasspath` (Java) loads them from a classpath resource packaged in the jar.
- A declared skill is exposed to a model only when the model lists it in `skills`. The `load_skill` and `bash` tools are then added automatically.
- `allowed_commands` whitelists the shell commands the `bash` tool may run — keep it as narrow as the skill requires.
- The built-in `bash` tool rejects file redirects and execution-changing environment assignments. File-descriptor duplication and closure remain supported; see the [Skills]({{< ref "docs/development/skills" >}}) documentation for the complete security contract.

### Integrate the Agent with Flink

Register the Ollama chat model connection, create a stream of questions, and apply the agent.

{{< tabs "Integrate the Agent with Flink" >}}

{{< tab "Python" >}}
```python
# Set up the Flink streaming environment and the Agents execution environment.
env = StreamExecutionEnvironment.get_execution_environment()
agents_env = AgentsExecutionEnvironment.get_execution_environment(env)

# Add Ollama chat model connection to be used by the MathAgent.
agents_env.add_resource(
    "ollama_server", ResourceType.CHAT_MODEL_CONNECTION, ollama_server_descriptor
)

# A small stream of arithmetic questions to answer.
question_stream = env.from_collection(
    ["What is (2 + 3) * 4?", "Compute 2 ^ 10.", "What is 144 divided by 12?"]
)

# Use the MathAgent to answer each question with the math-calculator skill.
answer_stream = (
    agents_env.from_datastream(input=question_stream, key_selector=lambda x: x)
    .apply(MathAgent())
    .to_datastream()
)

# Print the answers to stdout.
answer_stream.print()
# Execute the Flink pipeline with the Flink job name.
agents_env.execute("Skills Agent Example Job")
```
{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab "Java" >}}
```java
// Set up the Flink streaming environment and the Agents execution environment.
StreamExecutionEnvironment env = StreamExecutionEnvironment.getExecutionEnvironment();
env.setParallelism(1);
AgentsExecutionEnvironment agentsEnv =
        AgentsExecutionEnvironment.getExecutionEnvironment(env);

// Add Ollama chat model connection to be used by the MathAgent.
agentsEnv.addResource(
        "ollamaChatModelConnection",
        ResourceType.CHAT_MODEL_CONNECTION,
        CustomTypesAndResources.OLLAMA_SERVER_DESCRIPTOR);

// A small stream of arithmetic questions to answer.
DataStream<String> questionStream =
        env.fromData("What is (2 + 3) * 4?", "Compute 2 ^ 10.", "What is 144 divided by 12?");

// Use the MathAgent to answer each question with the math-calculator skill.
DataStream<Object> answerStream =
        agentsEnv.fromDataStream(questionStream).apply(new MathAgent()).toDataStream();

// Print the answers to stdout.
answerStream.print();
// Execute the Flink pipeline with the Flink job name.
agentsEnv.execute("Skills Agent Example Job");
```

## Run the Example

### Prerequisites

* Unix-like environment (we use Linux, Mac OS X, Cygwin, WSL)
* Git
* Java 11+
* Python 3.10, 3.11 or 3.12
* `bc` (basic calculator), used by the `math-calculator` skill — preinstalled on most Unix-like systems

### Preparation

#### Prepare Flink and Flink Agents

Follow the [installation]({{< ref "docs/get-started/installation" >}}) instructions to setup Flink and the Flink Agents.

#### Clone the Flink Agents Repository (if not done already)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/apache/flink-agents.git
cd flink-agents
```

{{< hint info >}}
For python examples, you can skip this step and submit the python file in installed flink-agents wheel.
{{< /hint >}}

#### Deploy a Standalone Flink Cluster

You can deploy a standalone Flink cluster in your local environment with the following command.

{{< tabs "Deploy a Standalone Flink Cluster" >}}

{{< tab "Python" >}}
```bash
export PYTHONPATH=$(python -c 'import sysconfig; print(sysconfig.get_paths()["purelib"])')
$FLINK_HOME/bin/start-cluster.sh
```
{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab "Java" >}}
1. Build Flink Agents from source to generate example jar. See [installation]({{< ref "docs/get-started/installation" >}}) for more details.
2. Start the Flink cluster
    ```bash
    $FLINK_HOME/bin/start-cluster.sh
    ```

{{< hint info >}}
To run example on JDK 21+, append jvm option `--add-exports=java.base/jdk.internal.vm=ALL-UNNAMED` to [env.java.opts.all](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-stable/docs/deployment/config/#env-java-opts-all) in `$FLINK_HOME/conf/config.yaml` before starting the Flink cluster.
{{< /hint >}}
{{< /tab >}}

{{< /tabs >}}
You can refer to the [local cluster](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.20/docs/try-flink/local_installation/#starting-and-stopping-a-local-cluster) instructions for more detailed steps.

{{< hint info >}}
If you can't navigate to the web UI at [localhost:8081](localhost:8081), you can find the reason in `$FLINK_HOME/log`. If the reason is port conflict, you can change the port in `$FLINK_HOME/conf/config.yaml`.
{{< /hint >}}

#### Prepare Ollama

Download and install Ollama from the official [website](https://ollama.com/download).

{{< hint info >}}
Ollama server **0.9.0** or higher is required.
{{< /hint >}}

Then pull the qwen3.5:9b model, which is required by the quickstart examples.

```bash
ollama pull qwen3.5:9b
```

### Submit Flink Agents Job to Standalone Flink Cluster

#### Submit to Flink Cluster

{{< tabs "Submit to Flink Cluster" >}}

{{< tab "Python" >}}
```bash
export PYTHONPATH=$(python -c 'import sysconfig; print(sysconfig.get_paths()["purelib"])')

# Run the agent skills example
$FLINK_HOME/bin/flink run -py ./flink-agents/python/flink_agents/examples/quickstart/skills_agent_example.py
# or submit the example python file in installed flink-agents wheel
$FLINK_HOME/bin/flink run -py  $PYTHONPATH/flink_agents/examples/quickstart/skills_agent_example.py
```
{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab "Java" >}}
```bash
$FLINK_HOME/bin/flink run -c org.apache.flink.agents.examples.SkillsAgentExample ./flink-agents/examples/target/flink-agents-examples-$VERSION.jar
```
{{< /tab >}}

{{< /tabs >}}

Now you should see a Flink job submitted to the Flink Cluster in Flink web UI [localhost:8081](localhost:8081).

After a few minutes, you can check for the output in the TaskManager output log.
