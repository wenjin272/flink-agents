## Overview

A **Skill** is a self-contained package of instructions, and optionally scripts and reference files, that teaches the agent how to perform a specialized task. A skill is just a directory containing a `SKILL.md` file. Flink Agents discovers the skills you declare, lets the agent decide which one is relevant to the current request, and loads its full instructions only when needed.

Skills follow a **progressive disclosure** model, so that providing the agent with many capabilities does not bloat every request:

1. **Discovery** — at startup, only each skill's `name` and `description` are injected into the system prompt (a few dozen tokens per skill), so the agent knows what is available.
2. **Activation** — when the agent judges a skill relevant, it calls the built-in `load_skill` tool to read the full `SKILL.md` instructions into the context.
3. **Execution** — the agent follows the loaded instructions, running any bundled scripts or shell commands through the built-in `bash` tool, and reading additional reference files only on demand.

Skills are a good fit when a capability is best described as a procedure (a runbook the agent follows) rather than a single function call. For a single, well-typed operation, prefer a [tool]({{< ref "docs/development/tool_use" >}}) instead.

## Skill Format

A skill is a directory whose name matches the skill, containing a `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter and a Markdown body:

````markdown
---
name: math-calculator
description: Calculate mathematical expressions using shell commands. Use when the user asks to perform arithmetic like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, or powers.
license: Apache-2.0
compatibility: Requires bash with bc (basic calculator)
---

# Math Calculator Skill

## When to Use
Use this skill whenever the user asks to evaluate a numeric expression.

## Method
Evaluate expressions with the `bc` calculator:

```bash
echo "(2 + 3) * 4" | bc
# Output: 20
```
````

**Frontmatter fields:**

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | Yes | Skill identifier. 1–64 characters, lowercase letters, numbers and hyphens only (no leading/trailing hyphen). Must match the value referenced in the chat model's `skills` list. |
| `description` | Yes | 1–1024 characters. Loaded at discovery time — write it so the agent can decide *when* to use the skill. State both what it does and when to use it. |
| `license` | No | License of the skill. |
| `compatibility` | No | Free-text note on runtime requirements (e.g. required commands), up to 500 characters. |

The Markdown body is the full instruction set loaded on activation. It may reference bundled files using paths relative to the skill directory (for example `python scripts/gen_joke.py`); those scripts and reference files are loaded only when the agent actually needs them.

A skill source is a directory holding one or more such skill subdirectories (or a `.zip` of that layout):

```
skills/
├── math-calculator/
│   └── SKILL.md
└── joke-generator/
    ├── SKILL.md
    └── scripts/
        └── gen_joke.py
```

## Declare Skills in an Agent

Declare where to load skills from with the `@skills`/`@Skills` decorator/annotation. The method returns a `Skills` resource built with one of its factory methods.

{{< tabs "Declare Skills in Agent" >}}

{{< tab "Python" >}}
```python
from flink_agents.api.agents.agent import Agent
from flink_agents.api.decorators import skills
from flink_agents.api.skills import Skills


class MathAgent(Agent):

    @skills
    @staticmethod
    def my_skills() -> Skills:
        # Load all skill subdirectories under a local directory.
        return Skills.from_local_dir("/path/to/skills")
```
{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab "Java" >}}
```java
import org.apache.flink.agents.api.agents.Agent;
// The @Skills annotation and the Skills resource share a simple name but live
// in different packages, so fully-qualify the annotation when importing the class.
import org.apache.flink.agents.api.skills.Skills;

public class MathAgent extends Agent {

    @org.apache.flink.agents.api.annotation.Skills
    public static Skills mySkills() {
        // Load all skill subdirectories from a classpath resource (packaged in the jar).
        return Skills.fromClasspath("skills");
    }
}
```
{{< /tab >}}

{{< /tabs >}}

**Key points:**
- Use the decorator/annotation to declare a skill source.
  - In Python, use `@skills`.
  - In Java, use `@Skills`.
- Declare more than one `@skills`/`@Skills` method on the same agent to combine sources; the runtime merges them and de-duplicates identical entries.
- Declaring a skill source only makes the skills *available*. A skill is exposed to a chat model only when that model lists it in its `skills` (see [Enable Skills on a Chat Model](#enable-skills-on-a-chat-model)).

### Skill Sources

Each factory method creates a source with a different scheme:

| Factory method (Python / Java) | Scheme | Description |
|--------------------------------|--------|-------------|
| `Skills.from_local_dir(*paths)` / `Skills.fromLocalDir(String...)` | `local` | One or more local directories, or `.zip` files, holding skill subdirectories. The path must be resolvable on the Flink TaskManager that runs the agent. |
| `Skills.from_url(*urls)` / `Skills.fromUrl(String...)` | `url` | One or more `http(s)` URLs, each pointing to a `.zip` whose top level holds the skill subdirectories. |
| `Skills.from_package(*pairs)` | `package` | **Python only.** One or more `(package, resource)` tuples locating skills inside an installed Python package. |
| `Skills.fromClasspath(String...)` | `classpath` | **Java only.** One or more classpath resource paths (e.g. under `src/main/resources/skills`). When packaged into a jar, the resource is materialized to a temp directory at runtime. |

{{< hint info >}}
The `package` scheme is Python-only and the `classpath` scheme is Java-only. A plan written in one language using the other language's scheme deserializes fine, but fails fast at load time. Use `local` or `url` for cross-language skill sources.

## Enable Skills on a Chat Model

A declared skill becomes usable only when a chat model opts in by listing it in `skills`. When `skills` is set, the framework automatically:

- injects the discovery prompt (the names and descriptions of the listed skills) into the system messages, and
- adds the two built-in tools the agent needs — `load_skill` (to read a skill's full instructions) and `bash` (to run its commands and scripts).

{{< tabs "Enable Skills on a Chat Model" >}}

{{< tab "Python" >}}
```python
@chat_model_setup
@staticmethod
def math_model() -> ResourceDescriptor:
    return ResourceDescriptor(
        clazz=ResourceName.ChatModel.OLLAMA_SETUP,
        connection="ollama_server",
        model="qwen3.5:9b",
        prompt="system_prompt",
        # Expose declared skills to this model by name.
        skills=["math-calculator"],
        # Whitelist the shell commands the bash tool is allowed to run.
        allowed_commands=["echo", "bc"],
    )
```
{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab "Java" >}}
```java
@ChatModelSetup
public static ResourceDescriptor mathModel() {
    return ResourceDescriptor.Builder.newBuilder(ResourceName.ChatModel.OLLAMA_SETUP)
            .addInitialArgument("connection", "ollamaChatModelConnection")
            .addInitialArgument("model", "qwen3.5:9b")
            .addInitialArgument("prompt", "systemPrompt")
            // Expose declared skills to this model by name.
            .addInitialArgument("skills", List.of("math-calculator"))
            // Whitelist the shell commands the bash tool is allowed to run.
            .addInitialArgument("allowed_commands", List.of("echo", "bc"))
            .build();
}
```
{{< /tab >}}

{{< /tabs >}}

**Key points:**
- `skills` lists the skill names (matching the `name` field in each `SKILL.md`) the agent may use.
- `allowed_commands` is a whitelist of shell command names the built-in `bash` tool may execute. Any command not on the list is rejected, so keep it as narrow as the skills require (for example `echo` and `bc` for arithmetic).
- The `bash` tool rejects redirects to files by default. File-descriptor duplication and closure, such as `2>&1` and `2>&-`, remain available.
- Assignments to environment variables that can change command resolution or executable loading, including `PATH`, `BASH_ENV`, `ENV`, `SHELLOPTS`, `CDPATH`, `LD_*`, and `DYLD_*`, are rejected. The command allowlist is a validation boundary, not a general-purpose operating-system sandbox; do not allow shells, privilege wrappers, or other commands that can launch arbitrary executables.
- The `load_skill` and `bash` tools are added automatically — you do not declare them in `tools`. They are added alongside any tools you do declare.
- Make sure the system prompt instructs the agent to load the relevant skill before acting, for example: *"You must load the skill first and strictly follow its instructions."* Without this nudge, smaller models may answer directly instead of consulting the skill.

Skills work with both the [Workflow Agent]({{< ref "docs/development/workflow_agent" >}}) (configure the chat model via `@chat_model_setup`/`@ChatModelSetup` as above) and the [ReAct Agent]({{< ref "docs/development/react_agent" >}}) (set `skills` and `allowed_commands` on the `ReActAgent`'s chat model descriptor, and register the `Skills` resource on the execution environment with `add_resource(..., ResourceType.SKILLS, ...)`).

## How Skills Work

Once enabled, a request flows through the three progressive-disclosure stages:

1. **Discovery.** The discovery prompt lists each available skill's `name` and `description` and explains how to load one. This is the only skill content the agent sees by default:
   ```text
   ## Available Skills
   <available_skills>
   <skill>
   <name>math-calculator</name>
   <description>Calculate mathematical expressions using shell commands. Use when ...</description>
   </skill>
   </available_skills>
   ```
2. **Activation.** When the agent decides a skill applies, it calls `load_skill(name="math-calculator")`. The framework returns the full `SKILL.md` body, including the skill's base directory and the absolute paths of its bundled resources.
3. **Execution.** Following the loaded instructions, the agent invokes `bash` to run commands (e.g. `echo "(2 + 3) * 4" | bc`) or bundled scripts (e.g. `python scripts/gen_joke.py`), and loads additional reference files only when an instruction points to them.

This keeps each request lean — a skill the agent never activates costs only its one-line description.
