## Overview

Beyond the Python and Java programmatic APIs, Flink Agents offers a **declarative YAML API** for describing agents. Compared with the programmatic APIs, the YAML API has the following advantages:

- **Human-friendly**: low entry barrier and easy to templatize across deployments.
- **Coding-agent-friendly**: a fixed schema reduces token cost, enables strict schema validation, and decouples configuration changes (declared parameters) from logic changes (action code).

A Flink Agents application is composed of three concepts; the YAML API exposes all three as declarative sections:

- **Events**: the messages flowing inside an agent. Every event has a type used for routing.
- **Actions**: code snippets triggered by events and emitting new events. They carry the agent's business logic.
- **Resources**: reusable components — Chat Models, Tools, Prompts, Vector Stores, MCP servers, etc. — referenced by actions at runtime.

A YAML file describes **Resources** and **Actions** declaratively; the **Event** types are referenced by name (built-in event aliases like `input` / `chat_response`, or your own event-type strings). The implementation classes (action functions, tool functions, custom types) still live in your Python or Java code; the YAML file only describes *how* those pieces are wired together.

If you'd rather declare agents directly in code, see [Workflow Agent]({{< ref "docs/development/workflow_agent" >}}) and [ReAct Agent]({{< ref "docs/development/react_agent" >}}).

## Declaring an Agent

This section walks through:

1. Declaring a single agent in one YAML file.
2. Declaring multiple agents in one YAML file.
3. Declaring shared Resources and Actions that any agent in the file (or any later-loaded file) can reuse.

### Declaring a single agent

The example below declares one agent named `review_analysis_agent` with a chat-model connection, a chat-model setup, a function tool, and two actions. It demonstrates every field you typically use.

```yaml
agents:
  - name: review_analysis_agent
    description: Analyze product reviews and emit a satisfaction score.

    # ---- Actions ----
    actions:
      - name: process_input
        function: my_pkg.actions:process_input
        trigger_conditions: [input]
        type: python
      - name: process_chat_response
        function: my_pkg.actions:process_chat_response
        trigger_conditions: [chat_response]
        type: python

    # ---- Resources ----
    chat_model_connections:
      - name: ollama_server
        clazz: ollama
        type: python
        base_url: http://localhost:11434

    chat_model_setups:
      - name: review_analysis_model
        clazz: ollama
        type: python
        connection: ollama_server
        model: qwen3:8b
        prompt: review_analysis_prompt
        tools: [notify_shipping_manager]
        extract_reasoning: true

    prompts:
      - name: review_analysis_prompt
        messages:
          - role: system
            content: "Analyze the review and return JSON with score + reasons."
          - role: user
            content: "{input}"

    tools:
      - name: notify_shipping_manager
        function: my_pkg.actions:notify_shipping_manager
        type: python
```

#### Agent properties

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | yes | Agent name. Must be unique across the environment. Used to apply the agent by name later. |
| `description` | no | Free-form description of what the agent does. Not surfaced at runtime. |

#### Resources

All resource sections are declared as lists under the agent. Each entry has a `name` unique within its section.

**Prompt** — declarative prompt template; pick exactly one of `text` or `messages`.

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | yes | Prompt name (referenced by chat-model setups). |
| `text` | one-of | Single-string prompt template. Corresponds to `Prompt.from_text` / `Prompt.fromText`. |
| `messages` | one-of | Multi-turn message template. Corresponds to `Prompt.from_messages` / `Prompt.fromMessages`. Each entry has `role` (`system` / `user` / `assistant` / `tool`) and `content`. |

```yaml
prompts:
  - name: prompt1
    messages:
      - {role: system, content: "..."}
      - {role: user,   content: "{input}"}
  - name: prompt2
    text: "this is the {value}"
```

`{variable_name}` is the only substitution syntax, and there is no `{{` / `}}` escape — write JSON examples in prompt `content` with single braces. See [Brace Handling]({{< ref "docs/development/prompts#brace-handling" >}}).

**Tool** — points at a callable that the chat model can invoke.

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | yes | Tool name (referenced from `chat_model_setups[].tools`). |
| `function` | yes | Fully-qualified callable in the form `<module-or-class>:<qualname>`. See [Function references](#function-references). |
| `type` | no | Implementation language: `python` or `java`. Defaults to `python` (see [Selecting the implementation language](#selecting-the-implementation-language)). |
| `parameter_types` | java only | Required for Java tools — one Java type FQN per declared parameter, in order. Forbidden for Python tools (the signature is reflected from the callable). |
| `injected_args` | no | Tool arguments injected by the framework at execution time. Declare a map from tool parameter name to `{source, key}`. These arguments are hidden from the model-facing tool schema. |

```yaml
tools:
  - name: my_tool
    function: my_pkg.tools:my_tool
    type: python
```

For **Java tools**, `parameter_types` is required because Java methods can be overloaded — list one FQN per declared parameter, in order. Generic type arguments are not part of the JVM method descriptor and must not be included (`java.util.List`, not `java.util.List<String>`). Boxed primitives (`java.lang.Integer`, etc.) and bare primitives (`int`, `boolean`, ...) are both accepted.

```yaml
tools:
  - name: add
    type: java
    function: com.example.MyTools:add
    parameter_types: [java.lang.Integer, java.lang.Integer]
```

To hide framework-owned arguments from the model, declare them in `injected_args` and bind each argument to a runtime source:

```yaml
agents:
  - name: order_agent
    tools:
      - name: query_order
        function: my_pkg.tools:query_order
        injected_args:
          tenant_id:
            source: config
            key: tenant_id
```

The supported `source` values are `config`, `sensory_memory`, and `short_term_memory`. If omitted, `source` defaults to `sensory_memory`. For `config`, `key` is read from the agent execution environment configuration. For memory sources, `key` is the memory path.

For Java tools loaded from YAML, the `injected_args` entry itself marks the parameter
as framework-injected and hides it from the model-facing schema. The Java method may
use `@ToolParam(name = "...")` to provide stable parameter names, but it does not need
`@ToolParam(injected = true)` when injection is declared in YAML.
If both YAML and the tool function declare the same injected parameter, they must use
the same source and key; conflicting declarations fail during agent plan construction.

Per-request values, such as a trace id written to sensory memory before tool execution, can be injected the same way:

```yaml
agents:
  - name: traced_order_agent
    tools:
      - name: lookup_order
        function: my_pkg.tools:lookup_order
        injected_args:
          trace_id:
            source: sensory_memory
            key: request.trace_id
```

```yaml
# Java-loaded YAML
agents:
  - name: java_order_agent
    tools:
      - name: queryOrder
        type: java
        function: com.example.OrderTools:queryOrder
        parameter_types: [java.lang.String, java.lang.String]
        injected_args:
          tenant_id:
            source: config
            key: tenant_id
```

**Skills** — bundles of agent skill assets loaded from one or more sources. At least one of `paths` / `urls` / `classpath` / `package` must be non-empty; multiple sources can coexist.

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | yes | Skills resource name. |
| `paths` | one-of | `local` scheme: list of directories or `.zip` files. |
| `urls` | one-of | `url` scheme: list of `http(s)` URLs pointing to `.zip` archives. |
| `classpath` | one-of | `classpath` scheme (Java runtime only): list of classpath resource paths. |
| `package` | one-of | `package` scheme (Python runtime only): list of `{package, resource}` pairs. |

```yaml
skills:
  - name: agent_skills
    paths:
      - ./skills
    urls:
      - https://example.com/skills.zip
    classpath:
      - skills/my-skills
    package:
      - package: my_pkg
        resource: skills/
```

`classpath` is accepted by the Python parser for schema parity with Java but rejected at runtime, because the Python runtime does not register a `classpath` handler.

**ResourceDescriptor-backed resources** — `chat_model_connections`, `chat_model_setups`, `embedding_model_connections`, `embedding_model_setups`, `vector_stores`, `mcp_servers`. Unlike the resources above (which are constructed inline by the loader), these are described by a `ResourceDescriptor` and instantiated by the framework at runtime. They all share the same shape:

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | yes | Resource name (referenced by other resources or actions). |
| `clazz` | yes | Either a built-in [alias](#class-aliases) (e.g. `ollama`, `openai`) or a fully-qualified class path. |
| `type` | no | Implementation language: `python` or `java`. Defaults to `python` (see [Selecting the implementation language](#selecting-the-implementation-language)). |
| *extras* | no | Any additional keys are forwarded verbatim as `ResourceDescriptor` init arguments (e.g. `base_url`, `endpoint`, `model`, `request_timeout`). |

```yaml
chat_model_connections:
  - name: my_connection
    clazz: ollama
    type: python
    base_url: http://localhost:11434

mcp_servers:
  - name: my_mcp
    clazz: mcp
    type: python
    endpoint: http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp
```

**Inter-resource references.** Several fields are not values but *name lookups* into another section, resolved within the agent first and then against shared resources. In the [single-agent example](#declaring-a-single-agent):

| Field | Refers to | Example |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| `chat_model_setups[].connection` | a `chat_model_connections[]` name | `connection: ollama_server` |
| `chat_model_setups[].prompt` | a `prompts[]` name | `prompt: review_analysis_prompt` |
| `chat_model_setups[].tools` | a list of `tools[]` names | `tools: [notify_shipping_manager]` |
| `embedding_model_setups[].connection` | an `embedding_model_connections[]` name | `connection: my_embedding_server` |

The referenced name must exist in the same agent or be a shared resource at the file level; otherwise loading fails.

#### Actions

`actions:` is a list. Each entry is either an inline action **map** or, when reusing a shared action, a bare **string** referring to the shared action's name.

Inline action (map) fields:

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | yes | Action name (unique within the agent). |
| `function` | yes | Fully-qualified callable in the form `<module-or-class>:<qualname>`. See [Function references](#function-references). |
| `trigger_conditions` | yes | List of event types the action listens to. Built-in [event aliases](#event-aliases) (`input`, `chat_request`, ...) or your own event-type strings. |
| `type` | no | Implementation language: `python` or `java`. Defaults to `python` (see [Selecting the implementation language](#selecting-the-implementation-language)). |
| `config` | no | Free-form configuration map passed to the action at runtime. |

```yaml
actions:
  - name: action1
    function: my_pkg.actions:action1
    trigger_conditions: [input]
    type: python
  - name: action2
    function: my_pkg.actions:action2
    trigger_conditions: [chat_response]
    type: python
  - action3                       # shared action reference (declared at file level)
```

Action method signatures are fixed (`(Event, RunnerContext)`), so there is no `parameter_types` field on actions.

### Declaring multiple agents in one file

A single YAML file can declare more than one agent under `agents:`. Each agent is independent and gets its own resource set; agent names must be unique within the file (and across the whole environment, once loaded).

```yaml
agents:
  - name: agent1
    description: The first agent
    # actions
    # resources

  - name: agent2
    description: The second agent
    # actions
    # resources
```

### Declaring and reusing shared Resources and Actions

Any resource section (`prompts`, `tools`, `chat_model_connections`, ...) or `actions:` declared as a **top-level sibling** of `agents:` is **shared**: it is registered on the `AgentsExecutionEnvironment` itself, and any agent in the file — or in any file later loaded into the same environment — can reference it by name.

**Shared resources** are referenced inside an agent simply by name:

```yaml
agents:
  - name: agent1
    description: The first agent
    chat_model_setups:
      - name: my_llm
        clazz: ollama
        connection: my_connection      # references the shared connection
        thinking: false

  - name: agent2
    description: The second agent
    chat_model_setups:
      - name: my_llm
        clazz: ollama
        connection: my_connection      # same shared connection reused
        thinking: true

# shared resource at the file level
chat_model_connections:
  - name: my_connection
    clazz: ollama
    base_url: http://localhost:11434
```

**Shared actions** are referenced inside an agent's `actions:` list by writing the action's name as a bare string:

```yaml
agents:
  - name: agent1
    description: The first agent
    actions:
      - action1                        # shared action
      - name: my_action
        function: my_pkg.actions:my_action
        trigger_conditions: [input]

  - name: agent2
    description: The second agent
    actions:
      - action1                        # same shared action reused

# shared actions at the file level
actions:
  - name: action1
    function: my_pkg.actions:action1
    trigger_conditions: [input]
    type: python
  - name: action2
    function: my_pkg.actions:action2
    trigger_conditions: [chat_response]
    type: python
```

{{< hint info >}}
Composing one agent across multiple YAML files is **not** supported. If two files loaded into the same environment declare the same agent name, or the same shared resource/action name, the second `load_yaml` call raises an error.
{{< /hint >}}

## Loading and Running

`AgentsExecutionEnvironment` exposes a `load_yaml` / `loadYaml` method that parses one or more YAML files and:

- registers all shared resources on the environment, and
- registers all declared agents on the environment.

Once loaded, an agent declared in YAML is applied **by name** through the same `AgentBuilder` as a code-defined agent — `.apply(...)` accepts either an `Agent` instance or the name of an agent previously registered on the environment.

{{< tabs "Load and Apply" >}}

{{< tab "Python" >}}
```python
agents_env = AgentsExecutionEnvironment.get_execution_environment(env=env)
agents_env.load_yaml("path/to/agents.yaml")

review_analysis_res_stream = (
    agents_env.from_datastream(
        input=product_review_stream, key_selector=lambda x: x.id
    )
    .apply("review_analysis_agent")     # look up the agent by name
    .to_datastream()
)
```
{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab "Java" >}}
```java
AgentsExecutionEnvironment agentsEnv =
        AgentsExecutionEnvironment.getExecutionEnvironment(env);
agentsEnv.loadYaml(Paths.get("path/to/agents.yaml"));

DataStream<Object> outputStream =
        agentsEnv
                .fromDataStream(inputStream, (KeySelector<MyPojo, String>) MyPojo::getId)
                .apply("review_analysis_agent")    // look up the agent by name
                .toDataStream();
```
{{< /tab >}}

{{< /tabs >}}

`load_yaml` / `loadYaml` accepts either a single path or a list of paths, and **can be called multiple times**. Multiple calls accumulate on the same environment; the same uniqueness rules apply across the combined state. Duplicate agent or resource names — within a file or across files — raise an error.

{{< tabs "Multi-File Loading" >}}

{{< tab "Python" >}}
```python
# Load multiple files in one call
agents_env.load_yaml(["./agents.yaml", "./shared.yaml"])

# Or call repeatedly — same result
agents_env.load_yaml("./agents.yaml")
agents_env.load_yaml("./shared.yaml")
```
{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab "Java" >}}
```java
// Load multiple files in one call
agentsEnv.loadYaml(Paths.get("./agents.yaml"), Paths.get("./shared.yaml"));

// Or call repeatedly — same result
agentsEnv.loadYaml(Paths.get("./agents.yaml"));
agentsEnv.loadYaml(Paths.get("./shared.yaml"));
```
{{< /tab >}}

{{< /tabs >}}

A common pattern is to split a topology file (the agents themselves) from an infrastructure file (chat-model connections, vector stores, ...). The infrastructure file can be swapped per environment (dev / staging / prod) without touching the agent definitions. The `agents:` block is optional, so an infrastructure-only file (no `agents:` block) is loaded as shared resources.

For an end-to-end runnable walkthrough that loads a YAML-declared agent and runs it on Flink, see [YAML Agent Quickstart]({{< ref "docs/get-started/quickstart/yaml_agent" >}}).

## Advanced Topics

### Function references

Actions and function tools point at user code through a single `function:` string in the form:

```
<module-or-class>:<qualname>
```

The colon separates the **left side** — a Python module or a Java class FQN — from the **right side** — the attribute path inside it.

{{< tabs "Function Reference Examples" >}}

{{< tab "Python" >}}
```yaml
# Top-level function in a module
function: my_pkg.actions:process_input

# Static method on a class (nested via dots in the qualname)
function: my_pkg.agents:ReviewAnalysisAgent.process_input
```
{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab "Java" >}}
```yaml
# Static method on a class
function: com.example.MyActions:processInput

# Static method on a nested/inner class
function: com.example.Outer$Inner:processInput
```
{{< /tab >}}

{{< /tabs >}}

### Selecting the implementation language

Every resource, tool, and action accepts an optional `type:` field with values `python` or `java`. When omitted, the default is **`python`** — both the Python loader and the Java loader treat a missing `type:` as `python`.

This means a YAML file loaded by the **Java loader** must set `type: java` explicitly on every resource, tool, and action whose implementation is in Java. Omitting `type:` on a Java resource in a Java-loaded YAML will make the loader try to build a Python-wrapping descriptor — usually not what you want.

When `type:` resolves to the **opposite** language of the loader, the loader builds a cross-language descriptor that delegates to the other-language implementation — see [Cross-language agents](#cross-language-agents).

### Provider aliases

For `clazz:` on resource descriptors and for event names in `trigger_conditions:`, you can use a short alias instead of a fully-qualified class path.

#### Event aliases

| Alias                          | Event type                       |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| `input`                        | `InputEvent`                     |
| `output`                       | `OutputEvent`                    |
| `chat_request`                 | `ChatRequestEvent`               |
| `chat_response`                | `ChatResponseEvent`              |
| `tool_request`                 | `ToolRequestEvent`               |
| `tool_response`                | `ToolResponseEvent`              |
| `context_retrieval_request`    | `ContextRetrievalRequestEvent`   |
| `context_retrieval_response`   | `ContextRetrievalResponseEvent`  |

For custom event types defined in your code, write the event's full `EVENT_TYPE` string instead of an alias.

#### Class aliases

Aliases for `clazz:` are keyed on resource type **and** implementation language. The same alias (e.g. `ollama`) resolves to a different class for `chat_model_connections` vs `chat_model_setups`, and for `python` vs `java`.

Common chat-model aliases:

| Alias                | `type: python`              | `type: java`                |
| -------------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `ollama`             | Ollama (Python)             | Ollama (Java)               |
| `openai`             | OpenAI Completions (Python) | —                           |
| `openai_completions` | —                           | OpenAI Completions (Java)   |
| `openai_responses`   | —                           | OpenAI Responses (Java)     |
| `anthropic`          | Anthropic                   | Anthropic                   |
| `gemini`             | —                           | Gemini (Java)               |
| `azure_openai`       | Azure OpenAI (Python)       | Azure OpenAI (Java)         |
| `azure`              | —                           | Azure AI (Java)             |
| `bedrock`            | —                           | Bedrock (Java)              |
| `tongyi`             | Tongyi (Python)             | —                           |
| `vllm`               | vLLM (Python)               | vLLM (Java)                 |

Embedding-model aliases (apply to both `embedding_model_connections` and `embedding_model_setups`):

| Alias     | `type: python` | `type: java`   |
| --------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| `ollama`  | Ollama         | Ollama         |
| `openai`  | OpenAI         | —              |
| `tongyi`  | Tongyi         | —              |
| `bedrock` | —              | Bedrock (Java) |

Vector-store aliases:

| Alias           | `type: python` | `type: java`    |
| --------------- | -------------- | --------------- |
| `chroma`        | Chroma         | —               |
| `mem0`          | Mem0           | —               |
| `elasticsearch` | —              | Elasticsearch   |
| `opensearch`    | —              | OpenSearch      |
| `s3_vectors`    | —              | S3 Vectors      |
| `milvus`        | —              | Milvus          |

The full alias tables live in `flink_agents.api.yaml.aliases` (Python) and `org.apache.flink.agents.api.yaml.Aliases` (Java).

If `clazz:` is not a known alias, the loader passes it through as-is — write a fully-qualified class path (e.g. `flink_agents.integrations.chat_models.ollama_chat_model.OllamaChatModelSetup`) for providers you've added yourself.

### Cross-language agents

Setting `type:` to the **opposite** language of the loader bridges Python and Java pieces in the same agent. The loader resolves the alias against the cross-language bucket and wraps the resource in the appropriate cross-language proxy.

Example — a Python-side agent whose chat model uses a **Java** Ollama setup that also calls a **Java** function tool:

```yaml
agents:
  - name: cross_language_agent
    actions:
      - name: process_input
        function: my_pkg.actions:process_input
        trigger_conditions: [input]
      - name: process_chat_response
        function: my_pkg.actions:process_chat_response
        trigger_conditions: [chat_response]

    chat_model_connections:
      # Python Ollama connection used by the math chat model
      - name: ollama_connection
        clazz: ollama
        request_timeout: 240.0
      # Java Ollama connection used by the creative chat model
      - name: ollama_connection_java
        clazz: ollama
        type: java
        endpoint: http://localhost:11434
        requestTimeout: 240

    chat_model_setups:
      - name: math_chat_model
        clazz: ollama
        connection: ollama_connection
        model: qwen3:1.7b
        tools: [calculate_bmi]               # python -> java tool via the bridge

      - name: creative_chat_model
        clazz: ollama
        type: java
        connection: ollama_connection_java
        model: qwen3:1.7b

    tools:
      - name: calculate_bmi
        type: java
        function: com.example.HealthTools:calculateBMI
        parameter_types: [java.lang.Double, java.lang.Double]
```

Loaded with `agents_env.load_yaml(...)` on the Python side, this produces an agent where:

- The Python `process_input` and `process_chat_response` actions are Python functions.
- `math_chat_model` is a Python Ollama setup that calls a Java function tool through the cross-language tool bridge.
- `creative_chat_model` is a Java Ollama setup driven from the Python loader via the Java chat-model wrapper.

The bridge is symmetric: the same file loaded by the **Java loader** can declare `type: python` resources, and the Java loader wraps each Python implementation through its Python wrapper. So a Java-side agent can drive a Python chat model or call a Python tool, just as the example above drives Java pieces from the Python loader.

Not every resource type is cross-language. Currently `actions`, `tools`, `chat_model_connections`, `chat_model_setups`, `embedding_model_connections`, `embedding_model_setups`, and `vector_stores` support `type:` on the opposite language; others (e.g. `mcp_servers`) do not.

## YAML API Specification

To help users and coding agents understand the YAML format and validate YAML files, Flink Agents publishes a language-neutral **JSON Schema** for the YAML document. The schema is checked in at [`docs/yaml-schema.json`](https://github.com/apache/flink-agents/blob/main/docs/yaml-schema.json) — point your IDE's YAML language server at it for inline validation and autocompletion.

The schema benefits both humans and machines:

- It defines an interface contract, so LLMs and external systems can interact with Flink Agents declaratively.
- It is language-neutral, so it doubles as the compatibility contract between the Python and the Java loader.

### Python and Java mapping

When loading a YAML file, both runtimes parse it into typed in-memory representations and validate it against them using the framework's native validation:

- The **Python loader** parses YAML into Pydantic `BaseModel`s declared in `flink_agents.api.yaml.specs`. Pydantic enforces the schema (required fields, value types, `extra="forbid"` on unknown keys, mutually-exclusive `text`/`messages` on prompts, ...).
- The **Java loader** parses YAML into POJOs declared in `org.apache.flink.agents.api.yaml.spec`, validated by Jackson with equivalent rules.

### Consistency guarantees

Because Pydantic models are easier to author and evolve than raw JSON Schema, the **ground truth** is the Pydantic spec — the checked-in `docs/yaml-schema.json` is exported from it. After changing the specs, regenerate the schema with:

```bash
python -m flink_agents.api.yaml.specs > docs/yaml-schema.json
```

The coding-agent skill under `dev/agent-skills/` bundles a copy of the schema so it can work offline, so refresh that copy in the same change. `python3 tools/check-skill-schema.py` reports whether it is current and prints the two edits needed when it is not.

Continuous tests then verify cross-runtime consistency:

- the JSON Schema exported by the Pydantic specs matches the checked-in `docs/yaml-schema.json`;
- the Java POJOs match the checked-in `docs/yaml-schema.json` in property names, required fields, and `additionalProperties` strictness;
- the Pydantic specs stay aligned with the Python `Agent` API;
- the Java POJOs stay aligned with the Java `Agent` API.

This keeps the YAML API a true cross-language contract: a YAML file that validates against the schema is guaranteed to load and run on either the Python or the Java loader (subject only to the language-specific differences documented above, such as `parameter_types` on Java tools).
