## How to configure Flink Agents

There are two ways to configure Flink Agents, listed in order of **priority from high to low**:

1. **Setting via the AgentsExecutionEnvironment**
2. **Setting via a Flink YAML configuration file**

The AgentsExecutionEnvironment applies to Agents from the AgentsExecutionEnvironment, and the Flink YAML configuration file applies to all Flink Agents Jobs using the same configuration file.

{{< hint info >}}
In case of duplicate keys, the value from the highest priority will override those from lower priorities.
{{< /hint >}}

### Setting via the AgentsExecutionEnvironment

Users can explicitly modify the configuration when defining the `AgentsExecutionEnvironment`:

{{< tabs>}}
{{< tab "python" >}}

```python
# Get Flink Agents execution environment
env = StreamExecutionEnvironment.get_execution_environment()
agents_env = AgentsExecutionEnvironment.get_execution_environment(env)

# Get configuration object from the environment
config = agents_env.get_config()

# Set custom configuration using a direct key (string-based key)
# This is suitable for user-defined or non-standardized settings.
config.set_int("kafkaActionStateTopicNumPartitions", 128)

# Set framework-level configuration using a predefined ConfigOption class
# This ensures type safety and better integration with the framework.
config.set(AgentExecutionOptions.MAX_RETRIES, 3)
```

{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab "java" >}}

```java
// Get Flink Agents execution environment
AgentsExecutionEnvironment agentsEnv = AgentsExecutionEnvironment.getExecutionEnvironment(env);

// Get configuration object
Configuration config = agentsEnv.getConfig();

// Set custom configuration using key (direct string key)
config.setInt("kafkaActionStateTopicNumPartitions", 128);  // Kafka topic partitions count

// Set the list of event listeners
config.set(AgentConfigOptions.EVENT_LISTENERS, List.of(MyCustomListener.class.getName()));

// Set framework configuration using ConfigOption (predefined option class)
config.set(AgentExecutionOptions.MAX_RETRIES, 3);
```

{{< /tab >}}
{{< /tabs >}}

### Setting via the Flink YAML configuration file

The former `ErrorHandlingStrategy` API and `error-handling-strategy` option have been removed. To enable retries, set `max-retries` to a positive number (for example, 3 to retain the former `RETRY` mode's default budget). Its default is now 0, preserving the previous default behavior of making no retries. Terminal Chat failures are reported through failed `ChatResponseEvent` events instead of a `FAIL` or `IGNORE` policy.

Flink Agents allows reading configurations from the Flink YAML configuration file.

#### Format

As part of the Flink configuration file, the flink agents configuration must follow this format, with all agent-specific settings nested under the `agent` key:

```yaml
agent:
  # Agent-specific configurations
  max-retries: 3
  chat:
    async: true
```

#### Loading Behavior

By default, the configuration is automatically loaded from `$FLINK_HOME/conf/config.yaml`.

**Special Condition**

In the following case, Flink Agents may not locate the corresponding configuration file, necessitating manual configuration. If the file is not set, no configuration file will be loaded, potentially resulting in unexpected behavior or failures.

- **For MiniCluster**:
  Manual setup is **required** — always export the environment variable before running the job:

  ```bash
  export FLINK_CONF_DIR="path/to/your/config.yaml"
  ```

  This ensures that Flink can locate and load the configuration file correctly.

## Built-in configuration options

### Core Options
Here is the list of all built-in core configuration options.

| Key                       | Default                    | Type                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|---------------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `eventLoggerType`         | `SLF4J`                    | LoggerType            | Which built-in event logger to use. Valid values: `SLF4J` (writes JSON through a dedicated SLF4J logger so events show up in Flink's Web UI **Logs** tab) and `FILE` (writes per-subtask `.log` files under `baseLogDir`). Setting `baseLogDir` overrides this and forces `FILE`. |
| `baseLogDir`              | (none)                     | String                | Base directory for file-based event logs. If not set, uses `java.io.tmpdir/flink-agents`. Setting this value also implicitly switches `eventLoggerType` to `file`.                                                                                              |
| `prettyPrint`             | false                      | boolean               | Whether to enable pretty-printed JSON format for event logs. When set to `true`, each event is written as formatted multi-line JSON instead of JSONL (JSON Lines) format. {{< hint info >}}Note: enabling this option makes the log file no longer valid JSONL format.  {{< /hint >}} |
| `event-listeners`         | none                       | `List<String>`        | The list of event listener class names. Each class must implement the EventListener interface and provide a public no-argument constructor. {{< hint warning >}} Note: Currently, custom event listeners are only supported in Java. {{< /hint >}} |
| `action.trigger-condition.evaluate-failure-strategy` | `WARN_AND_SKIP` | ConditionEvaluationFailureStrategy | Handles event-time failures while preparing variables for or evaluating a compiled condition, including a dynamic non-Boolean result. <br/><ul><li>`WARN_AND_SKIP` (default): log a warning, treat that condition as false, and continue with later OR conditions.</li><li>`FAIL`: throw `IllegalStateException` and fail the Flink task; recovery follows the job's restart configuration.</li></ul> Plan-validation failures and runtime compilation or static type-check failures occur during initialization and are not handled by this option. |
| `max-retries`             | 0                          | int                   | Number of additional attempts per model call, including routing judge calls. Defaults to 0 (no retries).                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `retry-wait-interval`     | 1                          | int                   | Base wait interval in seconds between retries. Uses exponential backoff: the actual wait time for the Nth retry is `retry-wait-interval * 2^(N-1)` seconds. For example, with default 1s, waits are 1s, 2s, 4s, etc. Retry count and total wait time are reported in `ChatResponseEvent` and recorded as metrics (`retryCount`, `retryWaitSec`) under the configured ChatModel resource name. |
| `chat.async`              | true                       | boolean               | Whether chat asynchronously for built-in chat action.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `tool-call.async`         | true                       | boolean               | Whether the built-in tool-call action runs each tool via durable async execution.                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `tool-call.parallelism`   | os cpu count               | int                   | In-flight concurrency for tool calls from one `ToolRequestEvent` batch when `tool-call.async` is enabled. `1` runs tools serially; values greater than `1` run a parallel durable batch with a sliding window of at most that many concurrent tool calls. On **Java**, concurrent in-batch execution requires **JDK 21+** (Continuation API); below JDK 21 the batch still runs but tool calls execute serially. **Python** uses the shared async `ThreadPoolExecutor` and runs batches concurrently regardless of JDK version. Increases in-flight external calls; after failover, unfinished tools may be submitted again — side-effecting tools should be idempotent or provide a reconciler. {{< hint warning >}}**Default is parallel** (`os cpu count`). Chat, RAG, and tool batches share one `num-async-threads` pool **per operator subtask** (all keys on that subtask). Built-in actions for a single key run one at a time, so chat and a tool batch on the **same key** do not overlap in the usual chat → tool path; delay shows up mainly **across keys** on the same subtask. With defaults (`num-async-threads = 2× cores`, `tool-call.parallelism = cores`), one batch can use up to half the pool; several busy keys can still saturate it. Lower this value or increase `num-async-threads` on hot subtasks. {{< /hint >}} |
| `tool-call.batch.timeout.ms` | -1 (disabled)              | long (milliseconds)   | Overall timeout for one parallel tool-call batch. Non-positive disables it. On timeout, completed slots keep their outcome; slots that started but did not finish are recorded as failures; slots that never started executing (for example, queued in a saturated pool) stay pending, so they are re-executed after recovery instead of recording a false failure. Timeout cancellation is best-effort; external side effects from unfinished tool calls may still complete, so side-effecting tools should be idempotent or provide a reconciler. On **Java**, only enforced on **JDK 21+**; on JDK 11 the batch fallback ignores this setting and runs to completion serially. **Python** enforces the deadline in the batch await loop. {{< hint warning >}}**Thread reclamation:** a timeout unblocks the batch but cannot interrupt a tool that is still running; its worker thread stays in the shared `num-async-threads` pool until the tool returns on its own, so a tool that never returns permanently reduces pool capacity. Bound blocking work inside the tool (for example an HTTP client read timeout) rather than relying on this timeout to free the thread.{{< /hint >}} |
| `rag.async`               | true                       | boolean               | Whether retrieve context asynchronously for built-in context retrieval action.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `num-async-threads`       | os cpu count * 2           | int                   | Size of the fixed async executor created once per operator subtask. Chat, RAG, and parallel tool batches on **all keys handled by that subtask** submit work here. Default `tool-call.parallelism` is `os cpu count`, so one full tool batch can occupy up to half of this pool; multiple keys running large batches can saturate it. |
| `parallel-execution.enabled` | true                    | boolean               | Whether pure-**Java** agents run actions concurrently on the parallel execution engine when the continuation-based engine is unavailable (**JDK < 21**). Same-key input records still commit in input order, and checkpoint (exactly-once) semantics are unchanged. Set to `false` to fall back to the serial engine. Ignored when the JDK 21 coroutine engine is available, and for plans containing **Python** actions, which never use the parallel engine. {{< hint warning >}}**Experimental.** If you observe unexpected behavior on JDK < 21, set this option to `false` and report an issue.{{< /hint >}} |
| `max-in-flight-input-records` | 100                   | int                   | Maximum number of input records that may be in flight concurrently. Only enforced by the **JDK < 21** parallel execution engine for pure-**Java** agents; the JDK 21 coroutine engine and plans containing **Python** actions ignore it. Every admitted record consumes one unit of budget; at the cap, admission of further records blocks until an in-flight record retires. |
| `job-identifier`          | none                       | String                | The unique identifier of job, remaining consistent after restoring from a savepoint. If not set, uses flink job id.                                                                                                                                             |
| `event-log.level`         | STANDARD                   | EventLogLevel         | Global default verbosity for the [Event Log]({{< ref "docs/operations/monitoring#event-log" >}}). Valid values: `OFF` (skip event), `STANDARD` (payload may be truncated/summarized to keep logs concise), `VERBOSE` (full payload). Can be overridden per event type — see [Per-event-type log levels]({{< ref "docs/operations/monitoring#per-event-type-log-levels" >}}). |
| `event-log.trace.enabled` | false                      | boolean               | Whether to persist Agent Trace information in the Event Log. When enabled, business Events include trace context and Action/LLM/Parser/Tool lifecycle Events are logged. |
| `event-log.type.<EVENT_TYPE>.level` | (inherits) | EventLogLevel         | Override the log level for a specific event type. `<EVENT_TYPE>` is the event's routing type string (the same value that appears as `eventType` in the JSON log, e.g., `_chat_request_event` for built-ins, or `com.example.myapp.OrderEvent` for user-defined types). For dotted types, resolution walks up dot segments before falling back to `event-log.level`. See [Per-event-type log levels]({{< ref "docs/operations/monitoring#per-event-type-log-levels" >}}) for examples. |
| `event-log.standard.max-string-length` | 2000              | int                   | At `STANDARD` level, strings in the event payload longer than this are truncated. Has no effect at `VERBOSE`.                                                                                                                                                  |
| `event-log.standard.max-array-elements` | 20               | int                   | At `STANDARD` level, arrays in the event payload with more than this many elements are truncated. Has no effect at `VERBOSE`.                                                                                                                                  |
| `event-log.standard.max-depth` | 5                     | int                   | At `STANDARD` level, objects nested deeper than this are summarized. Has no effect at `VERBOSE`.                                                                                                                                                               |
| `short-term-memory.state-ttl.ms` | 0                    | long                  | Time-to-live for short-term memory state in milliseconds. Set to a value greater than 0 to enable TTL; 0 disables it.                                                                                                                                           |
| `short-term-memory.state-ttl.update-type` | `ON_READ_AND_WRITE` | ShortTermMemoryTtlUpdate | Update policy for short-term memory TTL. Only applies when `short-term-memory.state-ttl.ms` is greater than 0. Valid values: `ON_CREATE_AND_WRITE`, `ON_READ_AND_WRITE`. An enabled run-begin memory snapshot also refreshes TTL for entries it reads under `ON_READ_AND_WRITE`. |
| `short-term-memory.state-ttl.visibility` | `NEVER_RETURN_EXPIRED` | ShortTermMemoryTtlVisibility | Visibility policy for expired short-term memory state. Only applies when `short-term-memory.state-ttl.ms` is greater than 0. Valid values: `NEVER_RETURN_EXPIRED`, `RETURN_EXPIRED_IF_NOT_CLEANED_UP`.                                                        |

### Memory Event Options

The eight `memory.generate-event*` options have no raw `ConfigOption` default. When a sub-key and the master switch are both unset, the runtime uses the effective default shown below. See [Memory Events]({{< ref "docs/development/memory/memory_events" >}}) for resolution order, event payloads, and subscription examples.

| Key | Raw default | Effective default | Type | Description |
|-----|-------------|-------------------|------|-------------|
| `memory.generate-event` | unset | per-operation defaults | boolean | Master fallback for unset operation-specific switches. |
| `memory.generate-event.short-term-write` | unset | on | boolean | Emit short-term memory write events. |
| `memory.generate-event.short-term-read` | unset | off | boolean | Emit short-term memory read events. |
| `memory.generate-event.sensory-write` | unset | on | boolean | Emit sensory memory write events. |
| `memory.generate-event.sensory-read` | unset | off | boolean | Emit sensory memory read events. |
| `memory.generate-event.long-term-update` | unset | on | boolean | Emit long-term memory add/delete events. |
| `memory.generate-event.long-term-get` | unset | on | boolean | Emit long-term memory get events. |
| `memory.generate-event.long-term-search` | unset | on | boolean | Emit long-term memory search events. |
| `agent-run.begin-event` | false | off | boolean | Opt in to the agent-run begin event. Independent of the memory-event master switch. |

### Action State Store

#### Common

| Key                          | Default          | Type    | Description                                                                              |
|------------------------------|------------------|---------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `actionStateStoreBackend`    | (none)           | String  | The backend for action state store. Supported values: `"kafka"`, `"fluss"`.              |

#### Kafka-based Action State Store

Here are the configuration options for Kafka-based Action State Store.

| Key                                 | Default                  | Type    | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------------------------|--------------------------|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `kafkaBootstrapServers`             | "localhost:9092"         | String  | The config parameter specifies the Kafka bootstrap server.                  |
| `kafkaActionStateTopic`             | (none)                   | String  | The Kafka topic for action state. Dedicate it to one logical Flink Agents operator, shared by that operator's subtasks. |
| `kafkaActionStateTopicNumPartitions`| 64                       | Integer | The config parameter specifies the number of partitions for the Kafka action state topic. |
| `kafkaActionStateTopicReplicationFactor` | 1                     | Integer | The config parameter specifies the replication factor for the Kafka action state topic. |
| `kafkaActionStateTombstoneEnabled`  | false                    | Boolean | Whether pruning sends tombstone records so log compaction can reclaim pruned keys on a compacted action-state topic. Off by default: pruning does not invalidate older restore points, but the topic continues to grow. When enabled, the checkpoint whose completion triggers pruning remains usable, but restoring an earlier checkpoint or savepoint may replay later tombstones and re-execute already completed actions. Enable only if the job never restores from earlier checkpoints or savepoints, or if re-executing actions is acceptable. |
| `kafkaActionStateCleanupControlTopic` | (none)                 | String  | Separate, single-partition topic containing committed checkpoint-aligned cleanup boundaries. It must use `cleanup.policy=compact` without delete retention, differ from the action-state topic, and be dedicated to the same job recovery history. Setting it enables boundary enforcement during recovery. It cannot be combined with `kafkaActionStateTombstoneEnabled`. |

##### Checkpoint-aligned Kafka cleanup

Checkpoint-aligned cleanup is an explicit administrative operation. `KafkaActionStateCleanupTool` provides the same command-line workflow for Java and Python jobs. Run it with the Flink Agents runtime JAR and the matching Flink State Processor API JAR on the classpath:

```text
plan --checkpoint PATH (--operator-uid UID | --operator-uid-hash HASH) --output FILE
apply --plan FILE --bootstrap-servers SERVERS --control-topic TOPIC [--replication-factor N]
```

The `plan` command reads all recovery markers from the selected checkpoint or savepoint through Flink's State Processor API, creates a deterministic plan using the earliest required offset per partition, and refuses to overwrite an existing output file. Legacy map markers can still be restored by a job, but cannot authorize deletion because they do not identify the physical Kafka topic. The `apply` command verifies the content-derived plan ID before contacting Kafka. Plan files must contain exactly one JSON document; trailing content is rejected. The optional `--replication-factor` controls replication when creating the control topic, defaults to `1`, and must be between `1` and `32767`.

Review and retain the plan's deterministic JSON before applying it. The coordinator verifies that the selected offsets are still available, writes `COMMITTED` before calling Kafka `deleteRecords`, verifies every resulting beginning offset, and then writes `APPLIED`. Reapplying the same plan retries an interrupted committed operation without changing its boundary. Set `kafkaActionStateCleanupControlTopic` on the job only after the first plan is committed; recovery requires the configured topic to exist and contain a committed boundary, and fails closed if the topic is missing or empty.

Physical prefix cleanup requires the action-state data topic to use `cleanup.policy=compact,delete`, `retention.ms=-1`, and `retention.bytes=-1`. The store uses those settings when it creates a new topic. Before applying cleanup to an existing topic, alter it to those values. The `delete` policy enables Kafka's `deleteRecords` API, while both retention limits remain disabled so Kafka cannot independently retire records that a supported checkpoint still needs. Apply validates these effective settings before writing `COMMITTED` and rechecks them immediately before and after deletion.

For the first cleanup on an existing job, stop the job, create and apply the plan from the recovery point that will become the oldest supported one, and restart from that same point with `kafkaActionStateCleanupControlTopic` configured. This avoids a failover window in which the old running job does not yet know the committed boundary. Once the job is running with boundary enforcement enabled, later forward-only plans may be applied while it runs. Run only one `apply` operation at a time; concurrent incomparable plans fail closed and require operator intervention. Do not recreate the action-state topic or change its partitions while an apply operation is running: the coordinator checks the topic ID and partition set before and after deletion, but Kafka addresses `deleteRecords` by topic name and cannot atomically fence topic lifecycle changes.

The action-state topic and control topic must be dedicated to one job's recovery history. Once any boundary has been committed, every future run and restore of that history must retain the same control-topic configuration; omitting or changing it removes logical boundary enforcement. The boundary can move only forward. A checkpoint whose marker is below the committed boundary is rejected even if Kafka has not finished physical deletion.

Per-key tombstones and checkpoint-aligned cleanup are mutually exclusive. Tombstones are not tied to the selected recovery boundary and could invalidate a checkpoint that checkpoint-aligned cleanup promises to retain.

To migrate a job that previously emitted tombstones, first stop it cleanly so its Kafka producer closes and all accepted tombstone sends finish. Restart from the newest recovery point that is valid under the tombstone mode's existing recovery trade-off, with `kafkaActionStateTombstoneEnabled=false` and no cleanup control topic configured. After that attempt completes a new checkpoint or savepoint, stop it again, create and apply the first cleanup plan from that new recovery point, and restart from the same point with `kafkaActionStateCleanupControlTopic` configured. The new marker is after every old tombstone; selecting an older recovery point cannot provide the same guarantee because replay may still encounter those tombstones.
