## Overview

Flink Agents jobs run on Flink:

- **Language Support**: Python & Java
- **Input and Output**: DataStream or Table
- **Suitable Use Case**: Production

## Run in Flink

### Prerequisites

- **Operating System**: Unix-like environment (Linux, macOS, Cygwin, or WSL)  
- **Python**: Version 3.10, 3.11 or 3.12
- **Flink**: A running Flink cluster with version above 1.20.3 (including 1.20.3) and the Flink Agents dependency installed

{{< hint info >}}
**Note**: Python 3.12 requires Flink above 2.1 (including 2.1).
{{< /hint >}}

### Prepare Flink Agents

We recommend creating a Python virtual environment to install the Flink Agents Python library.

Follow the [instructions]({{< ref "docs/get-started/installation" >}}) to install the Flink Agents Python and Java libraries.

### Submit to Flink Cluster

{{< tabs "Submit to Flink Cluster" >}}

{{< tab "Python" >}}
Submitting Flink Agent jobs to the Flink Cluster is the same as submitting PyFlink jobs. For more details on all available options, please refer to the [Flink CLI documentation](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.20/docs/deployment/cli/#submitting-pyflink-jobs).

```bash
<FLINK_HOME>/bin/flink run \
      --jobmanager <FLINK_CLUSTER_ADDR> \
      --python <PATH_TO_YOUR_FLINK_AGENTS_JOB>
```
{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab "Java" >}}
Submitting Flink Agent jobs to the Flink Cluster is the same as submitting Flink jobs. For more details on all available options, please refer to the [Flink CLI documentation](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.20/docs/deployment/cli/#submitting-a-job).

```bash
<FLINK_HOME>/bin/flink run \
      -c <MAIN_CLASS> \
      <PATH_TO_YOUR_FLINK_AGENTS_JOB_JAR>
```

Now you should see a Flink job submitted to the Flink Cluster in Flink web UI (typically accessible at http://&lt;jobmanagerHost&gt;:8081).


## Consistency Guarantees

Flink Agents leverage Flink’s checkpointing to provide **exactly-once output consistency**. Exactly-once output consistency does not mean each event is processed only once; it means that every event will affect the state and output result exactly once. This is sufficient for typical data-processing use cases where the processing of data does not cause any external side effects.

However, actions in Flink Agents can trigger external side effects (for example, sending an email or invoking an external API). These side effects should not be executed more than once. To address this, Flink Agents support **exactly-once action consistency** by leveraging an external action state store.

### Exactly-Once Output Consistency

When a job runs on a Flink cluster, Flink periodically takes checkpoints. See [Flink Checkpointing](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.20/docs/ops/state/checkpoints/) for details.  
After recovery from a checkpoint, Flink Agents reprocess events that arrived after that checkpoint. As a result, any actions triggered by those events may be executed again.

### Exactly-Once Action Consistency

To ensure exactly-once action consistency, you must configure an external action state store. Flink Agents record action state in this store on a per-action basis. After recovering from a checkpoint, Flink Agents consult the external store and will not re-execute actions that were already completed. This guarantees each action is executed exactly once after recovering from a checkpoint.

When a completed Action is reused during recovery, its stored output Events keep their original Event IDs, while their lineage is rebound to the Event that triggers the reused Action in the recovered execution.

The same persisted action state is also used by fine-grained durable execution.

**Note**: Currently, Kafka and Fluss are supported as the external action state store.

See [Action State Store Configuration]({{< ref "docs/operations/configuration#action-state-store" >}}) for configuration options.

{{< hint info >}}
**Note**: Exactly-once action consistency is guaranteed only if, after recovering from the same checkpoint, inputs for each key arrive in the same order as before recovery. If this ordering requirement is not met, the system falls back to exactly-once output consistency.
