"""Agent that parks a built-in tool-call round so a checkpoint can capture it.

A deterministic mock chat model emits one tool call, and the tool then blocks on a
filesystem handshake, so the harness rather than the clock decides when the agent
run may finish. The chat request also carries an output schema, so the tool-call
context, that schema, and a ``bytes`` short-term-memory value all sit in
checkpointable state while the run is parked; the harness kills and restarts the
TaskManager, and the assertions below then run in a TaskManager process that never
performed any of the writes. Rebuilding the schema there resolves its class by name
from the module path recorded before the kill, so that path must still name this
class in the restarted process.

Submitted to a real cluster by ``checkpoint_recovery_job``. The module name is
deliberately neither ``*_test.py`` nor ``*_example.py``: the first would make pytest
collect it, the second would make the example-submission nightly submit it.
