# Preview. Names from the 4.6 generation onward carry no date and are pinned, so the
# name is itself the snapshot and is matched exactly.
#
# The three 4.5-generation names are aliases that front a dated snapshot, so a request
# may carry either the alias or the snapshot behind it and both have to match. Those
# match the alias itself or a name continuing with a "-" separator, which covers
# claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929. A name that extends the alias without that separator is
# a different minor version and is capable only if the exact set names it. The alias
# also has to retain the minor version: "claude-opus-4" would capture
# claude-opus-4-1-20250805, which predates the cutoff and is not capable.
#
# A name outside both sets reports not-capable and degrades to the prompt-engineering
# fallback rather than failing at the provider.

# Kept in its own storage rather than derived from the structured-output allowlists
# above, whose contents it currently coincides with. The two encode different
# documented boundaries: structured output starts at the 4.5 generation while prefill
# rejection starts at 4.6, so the three 4.5-generation names are structured-output
