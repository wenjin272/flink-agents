    * ``api_base_url`` defaults to ``http://localhost:8000/v1``, the default
      address of ``vllm serve``.
    * ``api_key`` defaults to a placeholder, since vLLM servers started without
      ``--api-key`` do not require a credential. Set it explicitly when the
      server is started with ``--api-key``.

    Defaults are applied for ``None``, empty, and whitespace-only values,
    matching the Java connection. Unlike :class:`OpenAIChatModelConnection`,
    the ``OPENAI_API_KEY`` / ``OPENAI_API_BASE_URL`` environment variables are
    **not** consulted: the vLLM defaults deliberately do not depend on the
    developer's environment, and the Java connection has no environment
    fallback either.

    All other attributes (``timeout``, ``max_retries``, ``default_headers``,
    ``reuse_client``) behave exactly as in :class:`OpenAIChatModelConnection`.
