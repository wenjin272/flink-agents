"""Centralized registry that restores built-in event types at the JSON boundary.

Events cross the Python/Java boundary as JSON and are deserialized into the base
:class:`~flink_agents.api.events.event.Event`, whose ``attributes`` is a plain
``Dict[str, Any]``. Nested typed values (for example
:class:`~flink_agents.api.chat_message.ChatMessage`) therefore arrive as generic
dicts, and infrastructure that runs before an action — the event router, the
event log, and event listeners — observes an untyped event even for a known
built-in type.

:func:`restore` maps each built-in event type to its existing ``from_event``
reconstruction path, so a single call at the lowest-level deserialization entry
point (:meth:`Event.from_json`) covers every downstream boundary. This mirrors
the Java ``BuiltInEvents`` registry.

The contract is:

- A registered built-in type is reconstructed into its concrete subclass,
  preserving the event id, attachments, upstream event id, and upstream action
  name.
- An unknown or user-defined type is returned unchanged as a generic ``Event``.
- Restoration is idempotent: reconstructing an already-typed event is safe, so
  actions that still call ``from_event`` themselves keep working.
- A malformed built-in event fails clearly with a ``ValueError`` rather than
  surfacing an opaque reconstruction error.
