# That script's job is to decide whether Python agent memory survived a
# TaskManager kill, and almost all of it needs a real cluster. These tests cover
# the parts that do not: JSON extraction, the comparison operator, the wait
# helpers' failure reporting, the idempotent config edit, and the three
# assertions that turn observations into a pass or a fail.
#
# The emphasis is on failure reporting rather than happy paths. A recovery test
# that cannot distinguish "the condition was false" from "I was looking in the
# wrong place" reports absence when it means ignorance, and that is precisely how
# a test passes while verifying nothing.

# Needed for `run --separate-stderr`, used where a helper returns a value on stdout
# and logs on stderr. tools/test/run.sh pins bats to v1.11.0.
