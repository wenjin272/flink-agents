 * durable {@code "route:<router>"} persistence boundary, decision normalization, and the
 * observability event — so an executor only turns a declaration plus request context into a {@link
 * RoutingDecision}.
 *
 * <p>Durable sequencing contract: the engine's durable substrate replays a <b>flat, order-matched
 * call sequence</b> per action — durable calls cannot nest (a nested call would persist before its
 * enclosing call, but replay consults the enclosing call first, clearing the recovery state). An
 * executor that needs durable sub-calls of its own (the judge's chat call) therefore declares
 * {@link #usesDurableExecutionInternally()} and is invoked <i>before</i> the resolver's persistence
 * call, so its records land as flat siblings ahead of the decision record; on replay the executor
 * re-runs cheaply against its replayed sub-call records, and the replayed decision wins. Executors
 * without durable sub-calls run <i>inside</i> the persistence boundary and are never re-invoked on
 * replay.
