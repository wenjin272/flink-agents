/**
 * Bridges the user-facing {@link CustomRoutingExecutor} SPI into the engine's {@link
 * RoutingExecutor} contract. The user executor receives the data-only {@link RoutingContext} —
 * never the {@link RunnerContext} — so a custom strategy can select a model but cannot invoke one
 * (no unmetered chat calls inside the decision step).
 *
 * <p>Instantiation lives here — not in the API-layer {@code ModelRouter} — so the router stays pure
 * declaration data. It happens in {@link #prepare}, <i>outside</i> the persistence boundary: a
 * transiently failing user constructor throws fresh on every request instead of being persisted as
 * the decision's durable record and replayed forever. The instance is cached per declaration in
 * thread-confined state (routing always runs on the task's mailbox thread), so executor instance
 * state spans the requests of one subtask and is released with the task's thread — no locks, and no
 * pinning of a cancelled job's user classloader by JVM-global state. Construction contract, checked
 * without instantiation at plan time ({@code AgentPlan#validateCustomExecutor}): a {@code
 * (Map<String,Object>)} constructor fed the declaration's arguments, then a no-arg constructor, via
 * the thread context classloader.
