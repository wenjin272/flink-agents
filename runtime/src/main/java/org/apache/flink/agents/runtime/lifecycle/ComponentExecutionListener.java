/**
 * Observes component executions reported from within an action, at LLM, parser, and tool
 * granularity.
 *
 * <p>A component reports its lifecycle as a status event rather than as one callback per outcome,
 * so a listener that only cares about a subset matches on the event type and ignores the rest.
 *
 * <p>Invariants a listener may rely on, and must not break:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>The callback runs on the mailbox thread, so a listener needs no synchronization of its own.
 *   <li>An exception thrown by a listener is logged and swallowed, so reporting never fails the
 *       reporting component and never starves the remaining listeners.
 *   <li>The event carries the lifecycle status only; the reporting component is identified by the
 *       entity triple, which repeats on every report of the same execution.
 *   <li>The event instance is shared with every other listener, so a listener must treat it as
 *       read-only.
 * </ul>
